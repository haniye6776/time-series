In this project, Jena Climate data is used. These time series data are related to the meteorological conditions of Essen, which were measured at the Max Planck Weather Station in Germany. This data set contains various information such as temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, wind direction and other meteorological parameters that have been collected every ten minutes for several years. To analyse the data, first the data are divided into time windows of the same length and then they are modeled with a multi-layer perceptron.
